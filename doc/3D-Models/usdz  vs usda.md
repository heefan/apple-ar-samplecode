The terms "USDZ" and "USDA" refer to different file formats associated with Universal Scene Description (USD), a framework developed by Pixar for the interchange of 3D graphics and interactive scenes. USD addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed from many elemental assets. Here's a brief overview of the difference between USDA and USDZ:

1. **USDA (ASCII Format)**: USDA files are one of the human-readable text formats for USD, using an ASCII encoding. This format is designed for ease of editing and reading by humans and can be useful for debugging or for creating USD assets by hand. The "A" in USDA stands for ASCII. These files can be opened in any text editor, and their structure and content can be easily understood and modified by someone familiar with the USD schema.
    
2. **USDZ (Zipped Format)**: USDZ is a package or archive format that contains USD files (which can be in any of the USD formats, including USDA) and possibly other assets like textures, shaders, and metadata required for rendering the scene. The USDZ format is optimized for sharing and is designed to be easily transmitted and used across various applications and devices, particularly for augmented reality (AR) experiences on Apple devices. The "Z" in USDZ stands for "zipped" because it essentially encapsulates the USD data and associated resources into a single, compressed file.
    

In summary, USDA is a text-based format for USD that's easy to read and edit, while USDZ is a compressed archive format designed for easy sharing and use in applications, especially for AR. Both serve different purposes within the ecosystem of 3D content creation and distribution.
